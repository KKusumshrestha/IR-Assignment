But there’s no guarantee they will be genuinely affordableTo an outside eye, English cities might seem deliberately designed to foment a housing crisis. Unconstrained by craggy topography or fortified ramparts, their Victorian developers built endless streets of low-rise terraces. Cities that expanded during the Industrial Revolution are less dense than their European equivalents and have far fewer flats. Their private rental sectors are fragmented, dominated by small-time landlords for whom property ownership is often a second career.In recent years, large investors have begun bankrolling high-rise apartment blocks that promise to create the type of housing that English cities need. These “build-to-rent” developments are transforming the skylines of Manchester and London, and have added about 14,000 new homes each year since 2020. For a Labour government that hopes to build 1.5m homes, the sector’s growth looks like a blessing"

In my adopted home town in Somerset, meanwhile, local desperadoes had vandalised a pedestrian crossing close to a school, which had sparked an online row, partly because they had jettisoned their paint cans down a nearby alley. “Apart from the paint being dumped, I applaud them,” said one Facebook post.
